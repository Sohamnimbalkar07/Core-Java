->String is a java object that represents a sequence of chracters.
->java.lang.String class is used to create and manipulate strings thus it is a reference type not primitive type.
->string is immmutable  in nature it means manipulation of data we cannot do.
with string we can perform various operation like
search,substring,create new string
->java.lang.String is a class in java it implements several iterfaces like
Serializable,Comparable,CharSequence
->string is a final class we cant inherit
->serializable is a marker interface that contain no member or method,
it is just marking classes so that compiler may know about these classes,
->comparable used for ordering the object of any user defined  classes
found in java.lang.package and contain 1 method named comparedTo(object)
A charsequence is parent to 3 classes:-
string-immutable
string builder:-mutabble
string buffer:-mutable
->string in memory created in string pool,
java string pool refers to collection of strings which are stored in heap area
string pool will help saving space for java runtime

->we create string by 2 ways:-
new keyword,literal
String str="sid";
here str is reference variable pointing to sid
in string pool we store sid
now before string literal first look for string with same value in string pool if found it returns reference else it 
creates a new string in the pool and return the reference
String str1="sid"
now str1 also point to sid
once a literal is created it cannot be recreated
for different string literal we have different memory region created
--->
String object using new keyword it always create a new object in heap
String str=new String("sid"); here new obkect created in heap memory
thus we can create stringby literal and new keyword;


->String methods
boolean equals(object another):-checks the equality within the given object
equalsIgnoreCase():-compares another string without matching the cases
length():-return length of string
charAt(i):-returns character at index i
toUpperCase():-returns string in upper case
toLowerCase():-returns string in lower case
replace(oldval,newval):-replaces old occurances of specified char value with given vakue
trim():-removes the whitespaces from the begining and ending of string
contains("value"):-checks for the matching sequence of char value and return T/F
toCharArray:-convert a string to a new character array
IsEmpty():-to check string is empty or lot
endsWith():-checks if the string ends with specigied suffix
concat():-appending and get new string

-->
string class is final to prevent inheriting of its feature by other classes

In Java, String objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.
class Test{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   String s="Aman";  
   s.concat(" Agrawal");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s);//will print Aman because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}  
->String concatenation forms a new String that is the combination of multiple strings. 
There are two ways to concatenate strings in Java:

By +  operator
By concat() method
