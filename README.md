# üöÄ Core Java Mastery ‚Äì Exploring Core Concepts & Beyond

Welcome to my **Core Java** repository! This collection showcases my hands-on projects and exercises while learning Core Java concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections, Exception Handling, File I/O, Multithreading, and more. These projects demonstrate my understanding of Java fundamentals and real-world applications.

## üöÄ Technologies & Key Learnings

### üß© Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- In-depth mastery of OOP principles: **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**  
- Designed and implemented Java classes with well-structured constructors, methods, and fields  
- Created and leveraged abstract classes and interfaces to enforce contracts and extend functionality  
- Applied method overloading and overriding to maximize code reuse and flexibility  

### üóÉÔ∏è Collections Framework
- Hands-on experience with the Java Collections Framework (`List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`)  
- Implemented and used `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap` for various use cases  
- Explored iteration and manipulation of collections using enhanced for-loops and iterators  
- Understood when to choose specific implementations based on performance characteristics (e.g., `ArrayList` vs. `LinkedList`, `HashMap` vs. `TreeMap`)  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Exception Handling
- Solid use of `try`-`catch`-`finally` blocks to gracefully handle runtime errors  
- Defined and threw custom exceptions to clarify error conditions  
- Employed exception propagation and analyzed stack traces for effective debugging  
- Ensured robust program flow with proper resource cleanup and validation  

### üõ† File I/O & Serialization
- Read from and wrote to files using `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`, and `BufferedWriter`  
- Implemented **try-with-resources** for automatic stream closing  
- Serialized and deserialized Java objects to files for persistent storage  
- Processed CSV and text files to simulate real-world data import/export tasks  

### üåê Multithreading & Concurrency
- Created and managed threads via the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface  
- Ensured thread safety using `synchronized` blocks and `volatile` variables  
- Built concurrent workflows to perform tasks in parallel, improving throughput  
- Demonstrated coordination between threads using `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`

## üå± Java 8+ Features
- Embraced **lambda expressions** to write concise, functional-style code  
- Utilized the **Streams API** for declarative collection processing (`filter()`, `map()`, `reduce()`)  
- Leveraged `Optional<T>` to handle potentially null values without explicit checks  
- Applied **method references** and **functional interfaces** for cleaner callbacks  
- Explored the new **Date/Time API** (`java.time`) for immutable, thread-safe date handling

## üí° Skills Gained
- Strong foundation in **Core Java**: OOP, Collections, Exception Handling, I/O, and Concurrency  
- Proficient with **Java 8+** functional programming constructs and stream processing  
- Ability to choose the right collection type based on performance needs  
- Experience writing **robust**, **maintainable**, and **thread-safe** Java code  
- Familiarity with serialization, file handling, and resource management
