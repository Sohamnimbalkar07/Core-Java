1. ITC with sleep
started thrd  -- Producer
w entered --- Producer
Write Data Emp [id=1, sal=100.0]
w exited --- Producer
Press enter to exit
started thrd  -- Consumer
r entered --- Consumer
Read  Data Emp [id=1, sal=100.0]
r exited --- Consumer  //dataReady : false
w entered --- Producer
Write Data Emp [id=2, sal=200.0]
w exited --- Producer //dataReady : true
w entered --- Producer : blocked on sleep : inside the monitor , main : blocked on i/p, after user presses enter : blocked on join
, only runnable thrd : consumer --synched method : blocked on monitor : outside
Deadlock : circular dependency : i.e producer is waiting inside the monitor : for consumer to read data.
Consumer : blocked on monitor : unable to acquire to lock.
--------------------------------------------
2. ITC with wait
started thrd  -- Producer
w entered --- Producer
Write Data Emp [id=1, sal=100.0]
w exited --- Producer
Press enter to exit
started thrd  -- Consumer
r entered --- Consumer
Read  Data Emp [id=1, sal=100.0]
r exited --- Consumer --dataReady : false
w entered --- Producer : fav.
Write Data Emp [id=2, sal=200.0]
w exited --- Producer : dataReady : true
w entered --- Producer : Blocked on wait : outside the monitor
r entered --- Consumer : inside the montior : fav 
Read  Data Emp [id=2, sal=200.0]
r exited --- Consumer : Consumer : runnable
r entered --- Consumer : Blocked on wait outside the monitor
Reason behind deadlock : producer is waiting for the consumer to send explicit wake up call(notify)
consumer is waiting for the producer to send explicit wake up call(notify)
